    1 For Buyers
    </Typography>
    <br/>
     
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.1</span> Research the Seller: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Before making a purchase, research the seller's reputation on Gadalmarket. Look for
         reviews, ratings, or feedback from previous buyers to gauge their reliability and
        trustworthiness.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.2</span>  Verify the Item Details:
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
            Ensure that the item's description, condition, and photos provided in the listing match
            your expectations. If something seems unclear or suspicious, ask the seller for more
            information or additional photos.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.3</span> Use Secure Payment Methods: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Whenever possible, use secure payment methods such as Chappa or telebirr services
          offered by Gadalmarket. Avoid wire transfers or sending cash through mail, as these
          methods offer little recourse in case of fraud.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.4</span> Inspect the Item in Person: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          If feasible, arrange to inspect the item in person before completing the transaction. This
allows you to verify its condition and authenticity firsthand, reducing the risk of receiving
a misrepresented or faulty item.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.5</span>  Meet in a Safe Location: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          When meeting the seller to complete the transaction, choose a well-lit, public location
with plenty of people around, such as a coffee shop or shopping mall. Avoid secluded
areas or private residences, especially if you're unfamiliar with the seller.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.6</span> Trust Your Instincts: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          If something feels off or makes you uncomfortable during communication or the
meeting, trust your instincts and consider canceling the transaction. Your safety should
always come first.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.7</span> Keep Personal Information Secure:
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Avoid sharing sensitive personal information, such as your home address or financial
         details, with the seller until you're ready to complete the transaction. Use Gadalmarket’s
         messaging system to communicate initially.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.8</span> Report Suspicious Activity: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          If you encounter any suspicious behavior or fraudulent listings, report them to the
Gadalmarket support teams immediately. This helps protect other buyers and maintains
the integrity of the platform. 
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.9</span> Check feedback: 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          This helps to ensure the person is reliable. People who had experiences with particular
sellers leave reviews to keep others informed of how deals went. Take a minute to
check reviews before making a deal. Whatever experience you’ve had, other buyers
will appreciate you sharing it with them. Remember to view the “Feedback” section
whenever you have or plan to deal with a seller or service provider.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>

         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Meet with sellers face to face in a public place or request payment on delivery. Check
          out the item's quality and ensure it lives up to your expectations before you make that
          payment.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>1.11</span> Use common sense 
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Please, avoid anything that appears too good to be true. For example, unrealistically
         low prices or promises of quick money
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography fontWeight={'bold'}>

         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Ensure that your listings include accurate descriptions, clear photos, and honest details
          about the items or services you're selling. Misrepresenting your offerings can lead to
         distrust and negative feedback from buyers.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>2.2</span> Verify Buyer's Identity:

          messaging system or other means. Confirm details such as their name, contact
          information, and intentions to avoid potential scams.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>2.3</span> Use Secure Payment Methods:
         </Typography>
         <ul>
          <Typography>
          Encourage buyers to use secure payment methods such as Telebirr or offical bank
          payments when completing transactions. Avoid accepting personal checks, money
          orders, as these methods carry a higher risk of fraud.
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>2.4</span>  Meet in a Safe Location:

         <ul>
          <Typography>
          If you encounter any red flags or suspicious behavior from a potential buyer, trust your
instincts and proceed with caution. It's better to err on the side of caution than to risk
your safety or financial security
          </Typography>
         </ul>
         <Typography>
         <span style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}>2.6</span> Keep Personal Information Secure:
